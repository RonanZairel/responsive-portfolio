        <p class="intro">
          Hello! I'm Ronan Zairel L. Alcordo, currently a 3rd-year student at The University of the Philippines - Cebu, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. My journey in the world of technology has ignited my passion for UI/UX design, which has become my field of expertise and interest. I believe that good design is not only about aesthetics but also about creating intuitive, user-centered experiences that make technology more accessible and enjoyable.
