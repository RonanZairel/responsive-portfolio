        <!-- Introduction Text -->
        <p class="intro">
        I am currently a 3rd-year student at The University of the Philippines - Cebu, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. My journey in the world of technology has ignited my passion for UI/UX design, which has become my field of expertise and interest. I believe that good design is not only about aesthetics but also about creating intuitive, user-centered experiences that make technology more accessible and enjoyable.

      I’ve developed a diverse set of hard skills that support both my creative and technical pursuits. From front-end development using HTML, CSS, and React, to design tools like Figma and Photoshop, I enjoy crafting both the structure and aesthetics of digital experiences. I'm also equipped with programming knowledge in Python, version control with Git/GitHub, and video editing, allowing me to build, design, and present ideas effectively.
